MIUI-AcDisplay-Inspired-LockScreen
==================================
<h1>WIP</h1>
<br><br>
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.achep.acdisplay">AcDisplay</a> is one of the apps I miss
after the switch to MIUI. Unfortunately my version of MIUI doesn't support AcDisplay hence I decided to make a similar one. 
It's my first time making a MIUI lock screen. I welcome constructive comments! 
<br><br>
*** currently only tested on HTC m7 and MIUI v5 ***
<br><br>
Todo: <br>
- Fix buggy music controls <br>
- Add effects for buttons <br>
- Add effect for unlocker to make it more intuitive <br>
- Add 3rd party notifications (not sure if possible) <br>
